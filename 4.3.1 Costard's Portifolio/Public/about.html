<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Pedro Costard, passionate about game development and technology. I worked as a QA intern at EPRA Games, where 
  I handled quality control, identified and fixed bugs, and organized processes and documentation. I am currently pursuing 
  a degree in Digital Games at UNEB, expected to graduate in 2025</p>

<p>I have experience with .NET, C#, JavaScript, CSS, and Unity. My knowledge includes game design, script creation and analysis, 
  as well as agile methodologies like Scrum. I am fluent in English and hold certifications in data engineering, data science, 
  and Scrum. I participated as a programmer in GameJam+ 23/24 and maintain projects on GitHub and Itch.io, always striving to 
  improve my skills and create engaging interactive experiences.</p>
